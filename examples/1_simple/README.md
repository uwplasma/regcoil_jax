# 1_simple

Small, analytic geometry examples intended as the first place to start.

These inputs use simple (non-VMEC) torus geometry options and run quickly.

Suggested starting points:
- `regcoil_in.compareToMatlab1`: basic parity case.
- `regcoil_in.axisymmetrySanityTest_chi2K_regularization`: sanity check with `chi2_K` regularization.
- `regcoil_in.axisymmetrySanityTest_Laplace_Beltrami_regularization`: same geometry but using `Laplace-Beltrami` regularization.
